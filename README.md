# Repository for the Results of "OFC4DNA" - Optimizing Fountain Codes for DNA Data Storage
As the "results" folder is not strictly required and would drastically increase the repository size by including a huge amount of data (e.g., each generation for each experiment, including graphs for each iteration), they can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10604144 (results.zip).

## Instructions:
Extract the "results" folder into the OFC4DNA folder to be able to analyze and use these results.
You may need to change the path in some scripts to correctly plot some sub-experiments. Instructions are given at the appropriate position inside each script.
